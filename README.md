# Survey Monkey Bot
This is a python program that can fill in any survey monkey survey with any desired text or to vote in any poll. The program has been tested in python 3.8.5.

The program requires the chromedriver which can be found here:https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and the selenium dependency which can be installed using pip3 install selenium.

To determine the id of the element on the survey you would like to target, use inspect element. If you have any issues https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html has more information.
